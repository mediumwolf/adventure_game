# adventure_game
Text based adventure game from Futurelearn OOP course
This project was the end result of our excellent four week course using Python to learn/improve our knowledge and expertise in Object Oriented Programming
The game is not complete in the sense that you can not do everything you might want to do (like drop an item)  although it does play well and has some interesting features.
